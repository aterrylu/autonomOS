## ADR-001: Monorepo Structure
**Date:** 2026-03-03
**Decided by:** Terry + Nox
**Source:** Discord #🧭the-bridge (Mission Control category)

**Context:** Need a repo structure that supports two divergent paths (dev tooling + robotics) while sharing core abstractions.
**Decision:** Monorepo with `packages/` directory. `packages/dashboard/` for web UI, `packages/core/` for shared types and abstractions. Additional packages added as needed.
**Rationale:** Single repo keeps everything discoverable. Packages can diverge (robot-specific vs dev-specific) while sharing core types. Same pattern used successfully in the aquarium project.
**Alternatives:** Separate repos per path (too fragmented early on), single flat project (doesn't scale).
