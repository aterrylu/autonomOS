## ADR-016: Pinned Sessions with Stable Ordering
**Date:** 2026-03-13
**Decided by:** Terry
**Source:** Claude Code session (session persistence feature, PR #26)

**Context:** Sessions are ephemeral — they die on server restart. Users want certain sessions to survive restarts (e.g., long-running agents). Also, drag-to-reorder used ephemeral session IDs, so ordering reset on every restart.

**Decision:** Two features: (1) Pin sessions to persist across restarts. (2) Store session order using `claudeSessionId` (Claude Code's stable session UUID) instead of the ephemeral server-assigned ID.

**Pinning implementation:**
- `POST /api/sessions/:id/pin` / `DELETE /api/sessions/:id/pin` — toggle pin state
- Pinned sessions saved to `~/.autonomos/pinned-sessions.json` (validated on read)
- Server auto-resumes pinned sessions on startup, logging success/failure counts
- UI: pin icon (VSCode Codicon) appears on hover, stays visible when pinned

**Ordering implementation:**
- `sessionOrder` in Zustand store stores an array of `claudeSessionId || id` strings
- `sortSessions()` resolves each session against the order map, using `claudeSessionId` first (stable) with fallback to ephemeral `id`
- Fixed falsy-zero bug: `indexOf` returning `0` was treated as falsy by `&&` — switched to explicit `undefined` check

**Rationale:**
- `claudeSessionId` is assigned by Claude Code SDK and persists across server restarts — natural stable key
- File-based persistence (`pinned-sessions.json`) is simpler than a database for a personal tool
- Pin UX is familiar from browser tabs, IDE tabs, and chat apps

**Alternatives:**
- **Auto-persist all sessions** — Too aggressive. Most sessions are throwaway. Explicit pinning gives user control.
- **Database-backed persistence** — Over-engineered for v0. File-based with JSON schema validation is sufficient.
- **Session names as ordering key** — Names aren't unique and can change. `claudeSessionId` is a UUID.
