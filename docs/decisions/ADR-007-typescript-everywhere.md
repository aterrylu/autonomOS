## ADR-007: TypeScript Everywhere
**Date:** 2026-03-06
**Decided by:** Terry
**Source:** Claude Code session (architecture research with @Architect)

**Context:** Needed to choose the implementation language for server, dashboard, and core types.

**Decision:** TypeScript for all packages — server, dashboard, and core types.

**Rationale:**
- node-pty (terminal spawning) is a Node.js library — server must be Node.js
- xterm.js (terminal rendering) is TypeScript — dashboard is TypeScript regardless
- Shared types between server and dashboard with zero serialization/translation layer
- Claude Code, OpenClaw, YepAnywhere, Mission Control are all TypeScript — ecosystem alignment
- If we build our own agent framework, TypeScript is natural for a web-first platform
- Performance is sufficient — the server mostly shuttles bytes and parses JSON, not compute-heavy

**Alternatives:**
- **Go** — Better raw performance, great for CLI tools (k9s, lazygit). But loses shared types with dashboard, requires separate frontend build, and node-pty equivalent (no direct match) adds friction.
- **Rust** — Best performance, great for terminal tools (Warp, Ghostty, Zellij). But highest dev cost, Rust learning curve, and the server workload doesn't justify it.
- **Python** — DimensionalOS and amux use it. But worst performance for a server, no shared types with dashboard, and the team is TypeScript-native.
