## ADR-005: Web-First Desktop Shell, Package as Electron Later
**Date:** 2026-03-06
**Decided by:** Terry
**Source:** Claude Code session (architecture research with @Architect)

**Context:** Needed to decide the application shell for autonomOS — the single biggest architectural decision, as it determines tech stack, UX ceiling, distribution, and dev velocity. Researched 5 approaches in depth: Electron (VSCode-style), Electron thin wrapper (LM Studio, Zo), Tauri, pure terminal/TUI, and web-first.

**Decision:** Web-first architecture. Build a server (Node.js) that spawns and manages Claude Code subprocesses, serves a web dashboard (React or Svelte), and exposes REST + WebSocket APIs. Package as Electron desktop app later when the web experience is solid.

**Rationale:**
- Fastest path to v0 — no Electron boilerplate, IPC wiring, or native packaging to start
- YepAnywhere (Hono + React) and amux both validate web-first works for this exact use case
- Terminal embedding via xterm.js works in browser (server-side PTY streamed over WebSocket)
- Mobile/remote access comes for free — approve tools from phone, check on agents remotely
- The server IS the product — CLI, web dashboard, and future Electron wrapper are all clients
- LM Studio pattern: separate the backend daemon from the UI shell. Build the daemon first, add shells later.
- No tmux dependency — spawn Claude Code subprocesses directly from the server process

**Alternatives considered:**
- **Electron-first** — Richer native feel (menus, notifications, dock). But adds Electron boilerplate upfront, no mobile story, and the "real app" packaging can be added later. VSCode's xterm.js + node-pty is gold standard but not exclusive to Electron.
- **Tauri** — Tiny binary (~10 MB vs Electron's ~200 MB), low memory. But Rust PTY libs are less proven than node-pty, WebView inconsistencies across OS, and Rust toolchain adds friction. Good future option for packaging.
- **Pure terminal/TUI** — Terminal-native tools (k9s, lazygit) are loved by developers. SSH-friendly. But cost analytics need real charts, session replay needs rich rendering, and autonomOS aspires beyond session switching. amux uses tmux for process management but the UX is a web dashboard.
- **VSCode fork** — Maximum integration with developer workflow. But enormous maintenance burden (monthly rebasing, marketplace lockout). We're building mission control, not an IDE.

**Key insight:** tmux, Electron, and web are all just process management + UI. The server that spawns Claude Code, parses events, tracks costs, and manages sessions is the core product. The UI layer is swappable. Start with the lightest UI (web) and add heavier ones (Electron) only when needed.

**Research:** Full analysis in `docs/research/desktop-shells/` — 5 research documents covering VSCode/Electron architecture, LM Studio, Zo Computer, TUI frameworks, and a synthesis with side-by-side comparisons.

**Update (2026-06-29, ADR-051):** The "package as Electron desktop app later" clause is cancelled — see ADR-051. The web-first core (the server IS the product; the UI layer is swappable; start light and add heavier shells only when needed) is *reaffirmed*: the heavier Electron shell didn't earn its keep, so the canonical client reverts to web-first + PWA. The `docs/research/desktop-shells/` analysis above is retained as the historical justification for the web-first decision.
