## ADR-008: Local-First with Multi-Tenant Future
**Date:** 2026-03-06
**Decided by:** Terry
**Source:** Claude Code session (architecture research with @Architect)

**Context:** autonomOS could be built as local-only (personal tool) or designed from the start to support multi-tenant deployment (SaaS). Zo Computer is a reference for the SaaS model.

**Decision:** Build local-first single-tenant for v0. But architect with multi-tenant extensibility in mind — don't make decisions that would prevent scaling to a hosted SaaS product later.

**Concrete implications:**
- Use SQLite for v0 (zero ops, single user) but abstract the data layer so PostgreSQL can be swapped in
- Auth is optional for localhost but the auth middleware hook exists from the start
- API design should be tenant-aware in naming even if there's only one tenant (avoid hardcoding "my sessions" — use scoped queries)
- AI provider routing: start by letting Claude Code handle its own API calls, but plan for a multi-provider proxy layer that consolidates cost tracking across providers and models
- Configuration should support both file-based (local) and DB-based (multi-tenant) storage

**Rationale:**
- Local-first ships faster and solves the immediate personal need
- But the product has commercial potential — Zo charges $18-200/mo for a similar (though different) product
- The cost of "keeping the door open" for multi-tenant is low if done from the start (abstractions, not implementations)
- The multi-provider AI proxy is valuable even in single-tenant mode for consolidated cost tracking

**Alternatives:**
- **Local-only forever** — Simpler but caps the project's potential. Fine for a personal tool, limits commercial viability.
- **Multi-tenant from day one** — Over-engineering. Adds auth, tenant isolation, billing, and deployment complexity before we've validated the core product.
