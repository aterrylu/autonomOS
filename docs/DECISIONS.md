## ADR-001: Monorepo Structure
**Date:** 2026-03-03
**Decided by:** Terry + Nox
**Source:** Discord #🧭the-bridge (Mission Control category)

**Context:** Need a repo structure that supports two divergent paths (dev tooling + robotics) while sharing core abstractions.
**Decision:** Monorepo with `packages/` directory. `packages/dashboard/` for web UI, `packages/core/` for shared types and abstractions. Additional packages added as needed.
**Rationale:** Single repo keeps everything discoverable. Packages can diverge (robot-specific vs dev-specific) while sharing core types. Same pattern used successfully in the aquarium project.
**Alternatives:** Separate repos per path (too fragmented early on), single flat project (doesn't scale).

## ADR-002: Start with Observability, Add Control Later
**Date:** 2026-03-03
**Decided by:** Terry
**Source:** Discord #🧭the-bridge

**Context:** Dashboard could try to do everything at once — observe, configure, and control agents.
**Decision:** Phase 1 is read-only observability. Phase 2 adds control/configuration.
**Rationale:** Observability is safer (no destructive actions), teaches us what data matters, and is useful immediately. Control requires deeper integration and more careful design.
**Alternatives:** Build control first (risky without understanding the data), build both simultaneously (too much scope).

## ADR-003: Build on OpenClaw, Diverge If Needed
**Date:** 2026-03-03
**Decided by:** Terry
**Source:** Discord #🧭the-bridge

**Context:** Could build a custom agent runtime from scratch or extend an existing one.
**Decision:** Use OpenClaw as the agent runtime for now. autonomOS sits above it as a control plane. May fork/diverge later if OpenClaw's architecture doesn't fit.
**Rationale:** OpenClaw already handles agent config, cron jobs, memory, multi-channel routing. No need to rebuild that. Focus energy on the control plane layer that's missing.
**Alternatives:** Build custom runtime from day one (premature), fork OpenClaw immediately (unnecessary complexity).

## ADR-004: Name — autonomOS
**Date:** 2026-03-03
**Decided by:** Terry
**Source:** Discord #🧭the-bridge

**Context:** Needed a name that reflects agent-first, autonomous operation, and works for both dev and robotics paths.
**Decision:** `autonomOS` — autonomous + OS. Capitalization emphasizes "OS" (operating system for agents).
**Rationale:** Directly communicates the concept. Works as a CLI name, repo name, and brand. GitHub org `Autonomos` is taken (case-insensitive) but `aterrylu/autonomOS` as a repo is available.
**Alternatives:** mission-control (plain), cortex (taken in many contexts), conductor (too narrow — implies only orchestration), fleet (too robot-specific).

## ADR-005: Web-First Desktop Shell, Package as Electron Later
**Date:** 2026-03-06
**Decided by:** Terry
**Source:** Claude Code session (architecture research with @Architect)

**Context:** Needed to decide the application shell for autonomOS — the single biggest architectural decision, as it determines tech stack, UX ceiling, distribution, and dev velocity. Researched 5 approaches in depth: Electron (VSCode-style), Electron thin wrapper (LM Studio, Zo), Tauri, pure terminal/TUI, and web-first.

**Decision:** Web-first architecture. Build a server (Node.js) that spawns and manages Claude Code subprocesses, serves a web dashboard (React or Svelte), and exposes REST + WebSocket APIs. Package as Electron desktop app later when the web experience is solid.

**Rationale:**
- Fastest path to v0 — no Electron boilerplate, IPC wiring, or native packaging to start
- YepAnywhere (Hono + React) and amux both validate web-first works for this exact use case
- Terminal embedding via xterm.js works in browser (server-side PTY streamed over WebSocket)
- Mobile/remote access comes for free — approve tools from phone, check on agents remotely
- The server IS the product — CLI, web dashboard, and future Electron wrapper are all clients
- LM Studio pattern: separate the backend daemon from the UI shell. Build the daemon first, add shells later.
- No tmux dependency — spawn Claude Code subprocesses directly from the server process

**Alternatives considered:**
- **Electron-first** — Richer native feel (menus, notifications, dock). But adds Electron boilerplate upfront, no mobile story, and the "real app" packaging can be added later. VSCode's xterm.js + node-pty is gold standard but not exclusive to Electron.
- **Tauri** — Tiny binary (~10 MB vs Electron's ~200 MB), low memory. But Rust PTY libs are less proven than node-pty, WebView inconsistencies across OS, and Rust toolchain adds friction. Good future option for packaging.
- **Pure terminal/TUI** — Terminal-native tools (k9s, lazygit) are loved by developers. SSH-friendly. But cost analytics need real charts, session replay needs rich rendering, and autonomOS aspires beyond session switching. amux uses tmux for process management but the UX is a web dashboard.
- **VSCode fork** — Maximum integration with developer workflow. But enormous maintenance burden (monthly rebasing, marketplace lockout). We're building mission control, not an IDE.

**Key insight:** tmux, Electron, and web are all just process management + UI. The server that spawns Claude Code, parses events, tracks costs, and manages sessions is the core product. The UI layer is swappable. Start with the lightest UI (web) and add heavier ones (Electron) only when needed.

**Research:** Full analysis in `docs/research/desktop-shells/` — 5 research documents covering VSCode/Electron architecture, LM Studio, Zo Computer, TUI frameworks, and a synthesis with side-by-side comparisons.

## ADR-006: Agent-First Architecture, Claude Code as First Provider
**Date:** 2026-03-06
**Decided by:** Terry
**Source:** Claude Code session (architecture research with @Architect)

**Context:** autonomOS could tightly couple to Claude Code, or build a provider abstraction that supports multiple agent backends. Also considering whether to use an existing agent framework or develop our own.

**Decision:** Build agent-first with our own framework. Claude Code is the first provider, but the architecture should not hardcode Claude Code assumptions. The provider abstraction (F-010) exists from the start as an interface, even though only one implementation exists initially. We may develop our own agent framework within autonomOS over time.

**Rationale:**
- Claude Code is the immediate focus and what we use daily
- But the agent landscape is moving fast (Gemini CLI, OpenCode, Codex) — locking in would be short-sighted
- A clean provider interface costs almost nothing upfront (just an interface + one implementation)
- OpenClaw already abstracts multiple agent backends — same pattern applies here
- Developing our own agent framework keeps options open for the robot path and custom orchestration
- "Agent-first" means the platform is designed around agent concepts (sessions, tools, permissions, cost), not around any specific CLI tool

**Alternatives:**
- **Claude Code only, no abstraction** — Simpler to start but creates migration pain when adding providers. The CC-Insights approach (GPLv3, Dart, Claude-only) shows the risk of tight coupling.
- **Use an existing agent framework (LangGraph, Claude Agent SDK)** — These operate at a different layer (agent reasoning) vs autonomOS (agent orchestration/observability). Not mutually exclusive — our framework could use these internally.
